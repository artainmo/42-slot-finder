# 42-slot-finder

Bot that verifies if correction slots are to be found on a specific 42 school project.

## Usage

  Set environment

  ```
  make env
  ```

  Launch

  ```
  make
  ```

  Once launched, you will get the instructions.

## Explained

  This program uses selenium to launch a Firefox browser.

  It will then refresh the page to find correction slots every 42 seconds and notify with a sound and eventually email when there is an available slot on the page.

  It also shows progress in the terminal like so : `.....!.` where `.` means that there are no available slots and `!` means the bot found a slot on the page.
